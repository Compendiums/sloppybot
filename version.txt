**Version 2.2:**
-use !summoner <summoner name> to get a concise rundown of a summoner
    -for summoner names with two words, use quotes i.e. "Meme weaver"
    -its a work in progress
    -still pretty buggy due to riot's api request limits
-use !clashStats <summoner name> to get a rundown of an opposing clash team
    -the summoner can be any member of the team
    -for summoner names with two words, use quotes i.e. "Meme weaver"
    -only works for active clash teams

**Version 2.1:**
-sped up !sloppytoppy with caching

**Version 2.0:**
-sloppybot got a complete back end renovation:
    -now defined as a bot rather than client
    -!help now uses built in bot help functionality
    -fully utilizes the asynchronous processing
-sloppybot got a new server with quadruple the specs

**What's coming for the future:**
-error handling (Riot's APIs have been failing a lot recently)
-improve formatting of !sloppytoppy output
